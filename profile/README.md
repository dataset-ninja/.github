Here in Supervisely we got tired of sifting through garbage datasets on platforms that offer no visualization or insights. So, we built something we needed: a curated catalog of high-quality datasets for computer vision supercharged with:

- No worthless datasets of 10 images
- Explore labels and statistics
- Single JSON format with download link
- Only free datasets with open license
- Images, videos and 3D Cloud Points
- Regular updates with new data

Each repository in this organization is the source of all the calculated statistics and generated visualizations. Feel free to explore it, participate in [Discussions](https://github.com/dataset-ninja/dataset-ninja/discussions) or suggest which dataset we should add next!
